# IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY
Description
Developed a model that is very useful for data security.Here important data is an image so it should had be secured before sending.So in this model we used lsb steganography techniques and binary bit plane decomposition algorithm to achieve our goal.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: python
Key Features
Data Security:stores data of secret image in source image bits  

Efficient Data Retrieval: decryption
How It Works
In some bits of source image we put the secret image pixel so that after visualising it nobody can find secret image in this image.The source image look as it is at it was before storing secret image pixel.But after performing decryption we can get the secret image back.Using BINARY BIT PLANE DECOMPOSITION ALOGRITHM and LSB steganography we did 
//Ensured data privacy while maintaining optimized searchability.
